# Deep Learning with Python 

This section contains implementation of exercises mentioned in the book Deep Learning with Python by Fran√ßois Chollet. 
It provides insight into understanding basic concepts of implementing a NeuralNetwork, training, analysing, regularisation etc.

### BostonPriceRegression

This task consists of predicting the median price of homes in a Boston suburb. It has relatively few data points: only 506, split
between 404 training samples and 102 test samples. Here we implement a K-fold validation to tackle regression problems with less data points.
